Title: IoT-based Smart Irrigation Devices
Duration: May 2023 - August 2023
Supervision: Dr. Panchami V, IIIT Kottayam, Kerala

About
This research project focuses on developing an IoT-based smart irrigation system using a Raspberry Pi single-board computer. The system is programmed with Python to interface with various environmental sensors, including soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors. The collected data is analyzed in real-time, enabling efficient monitoring and control of the irrigation process.

Key features include:

Real-time Data Collection and Analysis: The Raspberry Pi collects data from the sensors, which is then transmitted to the ThingSpeak platform for visualization as graphs.
Automated Irrigation Control: Based on the sensor data, the system automatically operates water pumps to maintain optimal soil moisture levels, ensuring efficient water usage.
